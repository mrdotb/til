It's been some time since I my last today I learn. I guess the previous subject was not motivating enought.


# 42

I decided to focus on 42 projects again.

First thing, I wanted to do was to setup a proper environment. Of course I already have the gcc compiler and make installed. I wanted to be able to run the `norminette` locally. Using some abandonned project I was able to make it work inside docker. It was a bit painfull but I'm sure other student who find it will enjoy too.

*Back to c code 42 style*

First thing before I start anything, I want to cleanup my libft and create some usefull data structures (list, hash, array) and unit test with [munit](https://nemequ.github.io/munit/).

# Vim

I decided to give another chance to [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).

| git             | fugitive | action
| =============== | ======== | ===============================================
| :Git add %      | :Gwrite  | Stage the current file to the index
| :Git checkout % | :Gread   | Revert current file to last checked in version
| :Git rm %       | :Gremove | Delete the current file and the corresponding Vim buffer
| :Git mv %       | :Gmove   | Rename the current file and the corresponding Vim buffer
