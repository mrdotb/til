# Trigonometry

Nothing really new today, I saw a intresting animation on wikipedia [circle cos sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine#/media/File:Circle_cos_sin.gif) and I decided to reproduce it with javascript and canvas [circle cos sin](https://mrdotb.github.io/coding-math/trigonometry/circlecossin/). The animation scale according to the size of the window.
