# Vim

After review the source code of [vim-markdown-folding](https://github.com/masukomi/vim-markdown-folding)
I concluded that the comportement was not really a bug.
It require to put two `\n` after the end of the section and at least
one `\n` before and after a code block.


I write my first vim command and motion `Browser`. It's using [browser](https://github.com/mrdotb/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/browser)
a script a write who do a search on duckduckgo or wordreference and give focus
to the browser window using the `i3-message` api.
