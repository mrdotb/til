I give up on creating a vim plugin to highlight hex color, it already exist 
[Colorizer](https://github.com/chrisbra/Colorizer) and it's pretty hard to do.
I don't have other idea for the moment.

So I just spend the day looking at the source code and playing with two plugins:
+ [Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)
+ [Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)

Tabular is pretty cool you can automatically align stuff quickly

```
| number | Pronunciation |
| 0      | sun           |
| 1      | nueng         |
| 2      | song          |
| 3      | sam           |
```

With `:Tabular /|`. 4 keystrokes with my mapping <leader>t|<cr>


Ultisnips allow you to define rich text snippet very quickly.
I use the mapping `\u` to run the :UltisnipsEdit
