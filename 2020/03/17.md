# Vim

Today I installed new git plugins:
+ [goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim)
+ [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)

goyo is a way to turn vim in a Distraction free Mode.
We enter this mode using the `:Goyo` cmd

vim-commentary is a plugin to comment...
Use `gcc` to comment / uncomment a single line
Or motion or visual mode `gc`

# Tmux

I install [heytmux](https://github.com/junegunn/heytmux)
Then I started to play a bit with it and create a small script
in order to load heytmuxsession using fzf.
The cmd is [ht](https://github.com/mrdotb/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/ht)
I added  it to my dotfiles.

In order to write this script I read part of the tmux man.
tmux have a lot of usefull cmd.
I mostly used `send-keys`


Writing a full tmux manager seems interesting. The one existing use yaml for configuration files and I don't like this configuration format that much.

Project Idea: Write a tmux config manager using TOML, maybe rust

# Trigonometry

I want to improve my Math skill. Especialy the area usefull in computer programming.
Some days ago I started watching coding maths a youtube channel who match my demands.

It start with the basic SOH CAH TOA
I made a moving [sin wave](https://mrdotb.github.io/coding-math/trigonometry/sinwave/index.html) as a result of the 3 first episodes.
