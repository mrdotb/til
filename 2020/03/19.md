# Vim

## Autoload

How Autoload Works ?

When a user loads our plugin all of its functionality is loader. For larger
plugin autoloading can be a huge speedup.

```vim
:call somefile#Hello()
```

When you run this command, Vim will behave a bit differently than normal
function call.

If this function has already been loader, Vim will symply call it normally.

Otherwise Vim will look for a file called `autoload/somefile.vim` in your
`~/.vim` directory and any bundles.

Inside this file, the function should be defined like this:

```vim
function somefile#Hello()
 "...
```

You can use multiple `#` characters to represent subdirectories. For example:

```vim
:call myplugin#somefile#Hello()
```

This will look for the autoloaded file at `autoload/myplugin/somefile.vim`.
The function inside it needs to be defined with the full autoload path:

```vim
function myplugin#somefile#Hello()
 "...
 endfunction
```

## It's done

I finaly complete [learnvimscriptthehardway](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/),
